# 1 About the project
  
**Welcome to my IODS 2019 course project page!**

This project diary is basically me trying to learn how to do statistical analyses with R.  I look forward to improving my R skills and learning some good open data practices.<br/><br/>
  
**What I expect to learn?**
  
* Open data practices
* Practice R
* R Markdown (this is my first time using)
* Recap some data science analyses and good scientific practices

<br/>

**Where I learned about the course?**
  
I think I just brosed the HYMY courses in WebOodi
